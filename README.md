# Learn Data Science ðŸš€  
My personal experiments and notes during my journey of learning Data Science are preserved in this repository.  

## About the Project  
This project serves as a kind of journal documenting my adventure in exploring Data Science. Each notebook contains notes on specific topics along with experiments that test the validity of the concepts discussed. I have aimed to keep my notes as free from mathematical formulas and dry academic theory as possible, favoring more understandable explanations and simplified notation. If you'd like to use my notes for learning, I believe they will definitely be helpful to you.  

The project aims to:  
- Document my educational journey.  
- Share examples and insights that may help other beginners.  
- Experiment with various techniques and write my own library.
